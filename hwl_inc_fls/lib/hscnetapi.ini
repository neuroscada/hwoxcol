[log]
; The section describes various logging options for the Network API
; Debug Logger
;   Determines whether the server logger service (slogger) is used or not.
;   If this setting is omitted server logger is the default.
;   To use the old text log specify a value of "text file".
;   If using the slogger log method the filename and filesize entries are ignored
;   If using slogger the log can be accessed via HLV on the client by viewing system log "lognetapi"
; Debug Filename
;   The filename in which to store logging information
; Debug Filename2
;   When the size of "Debug Filename" reaches "Debug Filesize", it is copied
;   over "Debug Filename2" and the original log is cleared.
; Debug Filesize
;   The maximum size of the log file (in Kb)
; Debug IO Level
;   The paranoid level for Network API IO operations. A higher
;   value outputs more log entries.
;     0   = no logging
;     10  = errors only
;     100 = report all debuggin information
; Debug API Level
;   The paranoid level for Network API general operations

[Networking]
; This section describes various networking options for the Network API
; Get Timeout Milliseconds
;   Number of milliseconds to wait for the server to respond (read only functions)
; Put Timeout Milliseconds
;   Number of milliseconds to wait for the server to respond (read / write functions)
; Retries
;   Number of retries the client will attempt when communicating with each server connection
; Server Port UDP
;   The UDP port on the server with which to connect for reads (Exp R400 & later) or all transactions prior to Exp R400.
; Server Port Write UDP
;   The UDP port on the server with which to connect for writes (Exp R400 & later)
; Server Port TCP
;   The TCP port on the server with which to connect for reads (Exp R440 & later)
; Server Port Write TCP
;   The R440 port on the server with which to connect for writes (Exp R440 & later)
; UDP Hosts
;   The list of host base names that do not support TCP. This helps avoid trying and failing on TCP
;   prior to attempting UDP. It basically forces all connections for that host to be UDP.
;   Multiple basenames can be specified via semi-colon separation e.g. myhost;myotherhost;mythirdhost
;   If the system being connected to is redundant use the server basename eg "myserver" instead of "myservera;myserverb"
;   If your UDP only host is not listed, a delay of up to 5s may be experienced on the first Network API call.
; Flags
;   0x1 - Tells the server whether to strip strings from enums
